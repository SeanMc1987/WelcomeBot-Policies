Privacy Policy

WelcomeBot respects your privacy. This policy outlines what data is collected, how it’s used, and your rights.

1. Data Collection
WelcomeBot stores minimal data required for functionality, such as server IDs, channel IDs, and configuration settings. No personal user data (e.g., messages, usernames, IP addresses) is stored or tracked.
2. Data Usage
Stored data is used solely to operate bot features (e.g., welcome messages, diagnostics). Data is not shared with third parties or used for advertising.
3. Data Retention
Configuration data is retained as long as the bot is active in your server. If the bot is removed, associated data may be deleted automatically or upon request.
4. User Rights
Server owners may request deletion of their server’s data at any time via the support channel. No user-specific data is stored, so individual deletion requests are not applicable.
5. Security
All data is stored securely and backed up using atomic write strategies to prevent corruption or loss.
6. Contact
For questions or data requests, contact Sean via Discord or the support channel provided in the bot’s help command.
